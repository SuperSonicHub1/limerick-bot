# Limerick Bot

This is certainly something!

Currently only implements the rhyming structure of limericks, syllable structure coming soon.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_(poetry). Can someone explain to me how metric feet works?

## Setup
```
./download_model.bash
poetry install
# Add BOT_TOKEN to .env, then
poetry run python main.py
```
